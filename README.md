Number Guesser
This project is a number guessing game that allows players to select a number range and try to guess a randomly generated number within that range. It was created as part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Career Path.

Getting Started
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The game should load and prompt you to enter a range of numbers to guess from.

Gameplay
Once you have selected your number range, the game will generate a random number within that range. You can then enter your guess in the input field and click the "Guess" button to see if you are correct.

The game will provide feedback on your guess, telling you whether the number is too high or too low. You can continue guessing until you correctly guess the number.

Features
The Number Guesser game includes several features, including:

The ability to select a custom number range for guessing.
Feedback on each guess to help players narrow down their options.
A "Play Again" button to reset the game and choose a new number range.
